<h1>Arctic Monkeys Album</h1>

<br>Music is one of my biggest inspirations and it is especially useful when it comes to keeping me awake in the middle of the night to finish off my assignments or any other work. I thought it would be fun to redesign Arctic Monkey's album - Favourite Worst Nightmare as it is one of my favourite albums. This was the first album cover I have ever designed, and I wanted to achieve the minimalistic approach of designing as it was a style I wanted to understand more about a few years ago because I wanted to know how to make designs that look simple but does not look like it lacked balance and harmony. I used only lines to outline each members of the band to try to create an eerie feeling to reflect the album title. Red and blue colours were used as Arctic Monkeys is a British rock band. The choice of the typeface was decided based on their fast and loud music.</br>
