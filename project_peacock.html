<h1>Peacock Ridge </h1>

<br>I was free to choose any brand of wine and to redesign its label by giving them a new look and feel. The brand I chose was Peacock Ridge, and although its existing label design is appealing, I also felt it was rather plain. Its lack of colour and contrast does not make it stand out from the other wine bottles. I changed the design by emphasising on the illustration of the peacock, using colours that would stand out and look distinct on the shelves. Hot stamping was also used in order to give the wine label a more elegant, expensive and luxurious touch.</br>
