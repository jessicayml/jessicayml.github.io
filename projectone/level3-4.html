  	<header><h1>'Twas the Night Before Christmas</h1></header>
<h5><p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.<br>The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.<br>And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.<br>When out on the roof there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br>
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash.</div></h5></p>

 <p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the lustre of midday to objects below, when,<br>what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.<br>With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:<br>

<br>"Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!<br>To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"></p>

<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky<br>so up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came<br> with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes<br>were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

<h5><p>His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br>
He had a broad face and a little round belly, that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.</h5></p>

<p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.<br>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

<h5><p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings,<br>then turned with a jerk. And laying his finger aside of his nose,
and giving a nod,<br>up the chimney he rose. He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away<br>they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,<br>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</h5></p>
