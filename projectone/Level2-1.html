        <p><div align="center">Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the<br>
house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
<br>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.</p>

<p><div align="center">The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while<br>visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
<br>And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>
had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.</p>

<p>When out on the roof there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br>

Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash.</p>

<p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br>
gave the lustre of midday to objects below,
when,<br>what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.</p>

<p>With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br>
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came,<br>
and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:</p>

<p><strong><em>"Now Dasher! Now Dancer!<br>
Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br>
On, Comet! On, Cupid!<br>
On, Donner and Blitzen!<br>
To the top of the porch!<br>
To the top of the wall!<br>
Now dash away! Dash away!<br>
Dash away all!"</strong></em></p> 

<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
when they meet with an obstacle,<br>mount to the sky
so up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>
with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.</p> 

<p>And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br>
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
As I drew in my head and was turning around,<br>
down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</p>

<p>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.</p>

<p>His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!<br>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br>
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.<br>
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>
that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.</p>

<p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>
and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.<br>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br>
soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>

<p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.</p>

<p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,<br>

<h2><strong><em>"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</strong></em></h2></p>
