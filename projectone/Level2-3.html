<p><h6>'Twas<br>the night<br> before Christmas,<br>when all through the house<br>not a creature was stirring,<br>not even a mouse. The stockings<br>were hung by the chimney with care,<br>in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.<br>The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
while<br>visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.
And Mama<br>in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
had just settled our brains for a long<br>winter's nap. When out on the roof there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed<br>to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
tore open the shutter,<br>and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
gave the lustre of midday to objects<br>below,
when, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver,<br>so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came,
and he whistled and shouted<br>and called them by name: "Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch!<br>To the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"

<h5>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane<br>fly,
when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky
so up to the house-top the<br>coursers they flew,
with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling,<br>I heard on the roof
the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head and was turning<br>around,
down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
"He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
and his clothes<br>were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

<h4>"His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br>
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face<br>and a little round belly,
that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. "He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
and I<br>laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
soon<br>gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

<h2>"He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
and filled all the stockings,<br>then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
and giving a nod, up the chimney<br>he rose."He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a<br>thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,

<h1>"Happy<br>Christmas<br>to all,<br>and to<br>all a<br>good night!"</h1>
