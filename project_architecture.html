<h1>The Sound of Architecture</h1>

<br>This album design was done for a school project that expressed electronic music inspired by architecture. Characteristics of these famous buildings and electronic music were combined together by using typography and imagery and then formed into an identity system. * Please note that the images of the buildings used in this school project do not belong to me. If you are the owner and want the images to be taken down, please contact me at once. I can be contacted at jessica_yml@hotmail.com * </br>
