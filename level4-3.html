  	<header><h1>'Twas the Night Before Christmas</h1></header>
<p><h3>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.<br>The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.<br>The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.<br>And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.<br>When out on the roof there arose such a clatter,<br>I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash.</h3></p>

<p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the lustre of midday to objects below, when, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. 
More rapid than eagles,<br>his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:<br>

<br>"Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch!<br>To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</p>

<p><h2 id="yellow">As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky so up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>
with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur,<br>from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.</h2>

<p>His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br>The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. 
He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.

<p class="blue">He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.<br>A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</p>

<p class="blue">He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.<br>And laying his finger aside of his nose,
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight, "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</p>
