        <header>'Twas the Night Before Christmas&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Clement Clarke Moore</header>

<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house 
    not a creature was stirring, not even a<br>mouse.The stockings 
    were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas 
    soon would be</br>there. The children were nestled all snug in their 
    beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their<br>heads. And 
    Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our 
    brains for a long winter's nap.</br></p>

<p>When out on the roof there arose such a clatter, I sprang 
   from my bed to see what was the matter.<br>Away to the window 
   I flew like a flash, tore open the shutter, and threw up the 
   sash.</br><br>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the 
   lustre of midday to objects below, when,</br>what to my wondering 
   eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.
   <br>With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it 
   must be St. Nick.</br>More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came,
and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:</p>

<p><br>"Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, 
    Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!<br>To the top of the porch! To the 
    top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"</p>

<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky so up<br>to the house-top the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a</br>twinkling,I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head and was<br>turning around,down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.</br></p> 

<p>He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes--</br>
how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll<br>little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
The stump of a</br>pipe he held tight in his teeth,
and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and<br>a little round belly,
that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.</br></p>

<p>He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
A wink<br>of his eye and a twist of his head
soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. He 
spoke not a word,</br>but went straight to his work,
and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger<br>aside of his nose,
and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.</br>

<p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
<br>But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"</br></p>
