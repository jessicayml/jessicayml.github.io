            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Jessica Yu and I am a graphic designer. I had my undergraduate studies in graphic design in Singapore, and I am currently based in Los Angeles pursuing my masters program also in graphic design. I started picking up crayons and drew all over the walls of my house when I was really young.<br> 
            <br>So I guess I have always known since I was little that art and design is one of the things I want to strive in life. Being exposed to the design world totally changed my way of looking at everything.
            <br>
            <br>I was an intern at MTV Asia, and I have freelanced for ICBC Bank, GreenDot, and a few other clients. Having experiences in both the corporate and playful world and styles of design, I enjoy building great relationships with my clients and exploring different solutions and styles to best fit the nature of their projects. I believe one of the great attributes of a designer is being able to be flexible and not just stick to one style for all the projects. Don't be shy and contact me if you have any questions, or want to do a collaboration. Get in touch!</p>
