<h1>I Am Not Fine</h1>

<br>My teammates and I were interested in psychology and what provokes emotions. Whenever being asked: 'How are you?', the most common response would be 'I am fine' because we realized that as we grow older, we were taught to mask a smile and hide our real emotions especially our bad days. We decided to design a book targeted on the adolescence that shows different kinds of emotions and that it is totally normal to not feel okay and that it is also healthy to not bottle up your feelings. * Please note that the images used in this book for this school project do not belong to us. If you are the owner and want the images to be taken down, please let me know at once. I can be contacted at jessica_yml@hotmail.com * </br>
